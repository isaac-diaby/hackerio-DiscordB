### _HackerIo v1.4.0_

Join your friends, hack your enemies and develop your hacking skills. This bot is a fun hacking simulated game with hacks, levelling up, mini-games like connect 4, global rankings and weekly updates! Join in the fight to become the best hacker!

HackerIo is a Discord bot that tests players [Metasploitable](https://www.offensive-security.com/metasploit-unleashed/requirements/) commands to successfully hack and steal other players cryptos and reach higher levels. additionally there is an extendable libray of mini games ([connect 4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connect_Four))
Required Technologies for this application:

- NodeJs
- Typescript
- Discord.js
- MongoDB

I transformed the Discord.js library into TS because I wanted strong typing and structure to the project, this makes it easier for future development. I used MongoDB to save account details like their online status, amount of crypto, current level and other important information.
